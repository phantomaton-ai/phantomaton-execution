# Phantomaton Execution üîç

The Phantomaton Execution module is responsible for managing the execution lifecycle of Phantomaton AI agents. It provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for running Phantomaton instances, handling tasks, and coordinating with other Phantomaton components.

## Features üîß

- **Task Management**: Handles the scheduling and execution of Phantomaton tasks, ensuring efficient resource utilization and reliable task completion.
- **Sandboxing**: Runs Phantomaton instances in isolated sandboxes, preventing harmful or unintended behavior from affecting the broader system.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks the status and performance of running Phantomaton instances, providing insights for debugging and optimization.
- **Extensibility**: Allows for the integration of custom execution strategies and specialized task handlers through a plugin-based architecture.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

To use the Phantomaton Execution module, you'll need to install it as a dependency in your Phantomaton-based application:

```bash
npm install phantomaton-execution
```

Once installed, you can import and configure the module:

```javascript
import execution from 'phantomaton-execution';

const container = execution.create({
  // Provide any necessary configuration options
});

// Resolve the execution-related extension points
const [runTask] = container.resolve(execution.task.resolve);

// Execute a Phantomaton task
await runTask(myTaskDefinition);
```

## Extensibility üîå

The Phantomaton Execution module is designed to be highly extensible. You can create custom task handlers, execution strategies, and other components by implementing the appropriate extension point interfaces.
